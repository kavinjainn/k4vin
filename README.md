### 🔥 About Me

Hey, I’m **Kavin**, a high-school innovator turning wild tech ideas into real machines.  
I build everything from **AI stock predictors** to **swarm intelligence bots**, and now working on a **conscious smart device** with its own **Linux distro**.  
I don’t just code — I **design, wire, print, simulate, and test** everything till it’s perfect.
